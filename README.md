---

## 📌 Overview

**Project Atlas** is a next-gen project management method tailored for **Technical Program Managers (TPMs)**. It leverages **Airtable** for structured data, **Cursor** for AI-powered analysis, and **Beacon** for service ownership and dependency mapping. The result? A fully automated, intelligent workflow that transforms how programs are planned, tracked, and executed.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **TPM-Centric**: Designed around the TPM’s role in orchestrating cross-functional programs.
- **AI-Powered**: Uses Cursor to automate analysis, task creation, and planning.
- **Integrated**: Connects Airtable, Beacon, Jira/GitHub for seamless data flow.
- **Live Dashboard**: Airtable becomes the single source of truth for monitoring and reporting.

1. **📋 Program Charter Creation**  
   A **Product Manager** creates and updates the **Program Charter** in **Airtable**.

2. **🧠 Data Ingestion via Cursor**  
   The **TPM** uses **Cursor** to pull:
   - Program Charter  
   - Project metadata from Airtable  

3. **🔍 Dependency Mapping**  
   **Cursor** queries **Beacon** to retrieve:
   - Product/service dependencies  
   - Ownership details  

4. **🛠️ Task Generation**  
   **Cursor** analyzes dependencies and creates tasks in **Jira** or **GitHub**.

5. **📌 Auto Assignment**  
   Tasks are automatically assigned to the correct **service or product owner** based on Beacon data.

6. **🗓️ Project Plan Creation**  
   **Cursor** compiles:
   - Milestones from Airtable  
   - Tasks from Jira/GitHub  
   Into a **project plan**, stored back in Airtable.

7. **📊 Live Monitoring & Reporting**  
   - Airtable is updated automatically as tasks progress.  
   - **Airtable Automations** handle communication and reporting.

## 🎤 Demo & Pitch

### 🎙️ **Pitch:**

> “Meet **Project Atlas** — your AI-powered co-pilot for program management.  
> In today’s fast-paced product world, TPMs are buried under spreadsheets, dependency calls, and status updates.  
> We’ve built a system that connects **Airtable**, **Cursor**, **Beacon**, and **Jira/GitHub** to automate the entire lifecycle of a program.  
> From charter creation to dependency resolution, task assignment, and live dashboards — everything is handled intelligently and in real time.  
> With Project Atlas, TPMs can focus on strategy, not spreadsheets.”
